# Entity
:::caution
`Entity` and `Entry` are similar but different.
:::

`Entity` is a category that you see in miniSakai.  
For example, 
- Assignment
- Quiz
- Memo

are one of the `Entity` we display in miniSakai. `Entity` should have a **`Course`**, a **list of `Entry`**, 
and a **read flag** property for [Notification Badge](/features/notification-badge.md).

All these requirements are defined as `Interface` under [src/features/entity/type.ts](https://github.com/kyoto-u/comfortable-sakai/blob/master/src/features/entity/type.ts).

```typescript title="EntityProtocol"
export interface EntityProtocol {
    course: Course;
    entries: Array<EntryProtocol>;
    isRead: boolean;

    getCourse(): Course;

    getEntriesMap(): Map<string, EntryProtocol>;
}
```

Every `Entity` needs to inherit `EntityProtocol` and implement properties and methods.  


An `Entity` could have multiple `Entry`. For example, an Assignment Entity might look like this:

```typescript
const assignment = new Assignment(
    course, // Course Site info
    [new AssignmentEntry(), new AssignmentEntry(), new AssignmentEntry()],
    false // Read flags
);
```
