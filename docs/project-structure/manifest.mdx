# Manifest
Comfortable Sakai Extension manifests are managed by [`tasks/manifest-webpack-plugin.js`](https://github.com/kyoto-u/comfortable-sakai/blob/master/tasks/manifest-webpack-plugin.js)


## Manifest Plugin
This custom plugin dynamically creates `manifest.json` file, which is required for every Browser Extension.  

The base manifest file is [manifest.json](https://github.com/kyoto-u/comfortable-sakai/blob/master/manifest.json),
and differences for each browser is in separate file. Such as: [manifest-firefox.json](https://github.com/kyoto-u/comfortable-sakai/blob/master/manifest-firefox.json).  

`manifest.json` files are merged according to browser type when you build the extension.

## Manifest Version
Currently, manifest versions are as follows:
- Google Chrome: `v3`
- Firefox: `v2`
  - Also requires unique `"applications.gecko.id"`.
- Microsoft Edge: `v2`
- Safari: `v2`

```json title="manifest.json"
{
  "manifest_version": 3 // For Chrome as of now
}
```

```json title="manifest-v2.json"
{
  "manifest_version": 2 // For other than Chrome
}
```

## Extension Version
Comfortable Sakai versions are also dynamically created by this plugin.  
Version info written in [`package.json`](https://github.com/kyoto-u/comfortable-sakai/blob/master/package.json)
will be copied to `manifest.json`.  

If you are to change the version of the extension, you must put the version information directly in `package.json`.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "name": "comfortable-sakai",
  "version": "*.*.*", // PUT VERSION HERE
  "description": "Comfortable Sakai is a Web browser extension for managing assignments and quizzes on Sakai LMS.",
  "main": "index.ts",
}
```

## Default Locale
Default locale is written in [manifest.json](https://github.com/kyoto-u/comfortable-sakai/blob/master/manifest.json).  
```json title="manifest.json"
{
  "default_locale": "en" // Default is en_US
}
```
